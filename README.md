# My most complicated password generator
This is the most complicated password generator I have ever written.
## What can it make?
It can add:
Non-latin characters,
Emojis,
Unicode characters,
Symbols that aren't on the keyboard,
And all the standard things. (e.g. letters, numbers, symbols that are on the keyboard)
## Why did you make this?
For fun.
## Are there settings?
Yes! The settings are found in the script itself, near the top.
## "Passwords" generated by the script

To anyone who's got a lot of time on their hands, feel free to fork the code and add more unicode characters and emojis, or really anything. I didn't have a lot of time on my hands, so there's only 12 unicode characters and 12 emojis.
